# Introduction

Getting good sleep is often viewed as a simple matter of personal choice, but in New York City, sleep health reveals a complex story of neighborhood inequality and systemic disparities. 

As someone fascinated by the intersection of public health and social justice, I chose to explore how sleep deprivation patterns vary across NYC's diverse neighborhoods, particularly examining relationships with race and socioeconomic status from 2018-2022. NYC provides an ideal case study - within this densely packed city, neighborhood conditions can shift dramatically within blocks, from areas with serene tree-lined streets to those with constant traffic, sirens, and environmental stressors that make quality sleep elusive. These stark contrasts, combined with some of the nation's largest wealth gaps and the unprecedented disruptions of COVID-19, offer a unique window into how structural inequities manifest in something as fundamental as sleep. 

Through visualizing and analyzing CDC sleep health data alongside demographic information, this project investigates several key questions: How do sleep patterns vary across NYC neighborhoods? What roles do race and income play in these differences? And how did major events like the pandemic affect sleep disparities? Understanding these patterns is crucial, as poor sleep doesn't just mean feeling tired - it's linked to serious health conditions like heart disease and diabetes that already disproportionately impact communities of color and lower-income areas, potentially creating cycles where neighborhood conditions, sleep deprivation, and health challenges compound each other.

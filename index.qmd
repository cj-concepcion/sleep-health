# Introduction

Getting good sleep is a basic and essential human need, but the reality is that good sleep is a privilege in it of itself. The conditions in different neighborhoods create major disparities in sleep quality and health, and these differences are often seen along racial and economic lines. Areas with less resources face all sorts of environmental factors that interfere with the ability/opportunity to get good sleep - constant noise from traffic (i.e., sirens from ambulance or police activity), bright lights at night, and air pollution. Over time, these various factors can accumulate and possibly create long-term sleep problems. A lot of work in the social health field has found clear connections between sleep, race, and income that points to bigger systemic problems. Neighborhoods that have historically gotten the short end of the stick still face neglect today, with living conditions that make good sleep tough to come by. The stress of working multiple jobs or dealing with long commutes only makes things worse. Poor sleep leads to higher risks of heart disease, diabetes, and mental health problems - health issues that already hit communities of color and lower-income areas harder, creating a vicious cycle where bad neighborhood conditions hurt sleep, poor sleep hurts health, and poor health strains entire communities.

For this project, I wanted to investigate potential associations between race, socioeconomic status and sleep health within the context of New York City (NYC). NYC makes for a particularly interesting place to look at these sleep differences because of its sheer density and simultaneous racial and socioeconomic diversity. In this packed city, the quality of neighborhoods can change drastically within just a few blocks, and with some of the biggest wealth gaps in the country - where fancy high-rises stand right next to struggling neighborhoods - NYC may show particularly stark contrasts of how neighborhood conditions and economic inequalities affect people's ability to get good sleep.

I am also interested in looking at these data over time since there have been some major societal-level events that have disproportionately impacted NYC that created unique contexts through which these sleep health differences may have even been further exacerbated, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nGetting good sleep is a basic and essential human need, but the reality is that good sleep is a privilege in it of itself. The conditions in different neighborhoods create major disparities in sleep quality and health, and these differences are often seen along racial and economic lines. Areas with less resources face all sorts of environmental factors that interfere with the ability/opportunity to get good sleep - constant noise from traffic (i.e., sirens from ambulance or police activity), bright lights at night, and air pollution. Over time, these various factors can accumulate and possibly create long-term sleep problems. A lot of work in the social health field has found clear connections between sleep, race, and income that points to bigger systemic problems. Neighborhoods that have historically gotten the short end of the stick still face neglect today, with living conditions that make good sleep tough to come by. The stress of working multiple jobs or dealing with long commutes only makes things worse. Poor sleep leads to higher risks of heart disease, diabetes, and mental health problems - health issues that already hit communities of color and lower-income areas harder, creating a vicious cycle where bad neighborhood conditions hurt sleep, poor sleep hurts health, and poor health strains entire communities. (Meldrum et al., 2018; Kim et al, 2022; Hunter & Hayden, 2018\nFor this project, I wanted to investigate potential associations between race, socioeconomic status and sleep health within the context of New York City (NYC). NYC makes for a particularly interesting place to look at these sleep differences because of its sheer density and simultaneous racial and socioeconomic diversity. In this packed city, the quality of neighborhoods can change drastically within just a few blocks, and with some of the biggest wealth gaps in the country - where fancy high-rises stand right next to struggling neighborhoods - NYC may show particularly stark contrasts of how neighborhood conditions and economic inequalities affect people’s ability to get good sleep.\nI am also interested in looking at these data over time since there have been some major societal-level events that have disproportionately impacted NYC that created unique contexts through which these sleep health differences may have even been further exacerbated, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nPopulation Demographics: Race and Socioeconomic Data These data are available on the U.S. Census Bureau website, they just have to properly be queried at the zipcode tabulation area (ZCTA) level which ended up being more time consuming than initially planned because I could not find a way to get it at the ZCTA level without having to manually select/filter all the ZCTAs that fall within NYC. If you try to filter by county for instance, it will only give you the population demographics aggregated at the county level vs. ZCTA, which would not match our unit of analysis. This will be sorted soon! The good thing is there is a clear concrete plan and the data is there in a unit similar to to the sleep data (percentage or prevalence per ZCTA).\nSleep Data Over Time Sleep data are obtained from the CDC’s PLACES Local Data for Better Health datasets directly from the CDC website (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, 2023, 2024). The PLACES datasets are created with ZCTA-level estimates derived from data collected through the nationally representative annual U.S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The BRFSS is an annual, phone-based survey of the US population who are 18 years and older. The CDC works with local state health department to interview respondents. Every other year, the BRFSS includes a question asking “On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?”.\nUsing the BRFSS data, an estimate is created for the percentage of the population (per ZCTA) that reports sleeping &lt; 7 hours on average. Population data used to help model these estimates were drawn from the American Community Surveys (ACS) for each of the respective BRFSS years (2018, 2020, 2022). The ACS is collected and managed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Because sleep data is only collected every other year and PLACES short sleep prevalence estimates are created using the most recent year with available data (even if the year the data were collected does not align with the release year of the PLACES dataset) I plan to use the PLACES datasets for the years 2020, 2023, 2024 which created estimates for sleep using BRFSS data from 2018, 2020, and 2022. respectively (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, 2023 & 2024).",

I am thinking to do 1 missing data plot per year so as to not overcrowd the visual.",

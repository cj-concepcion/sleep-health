    "text": "1 Introduction\nGetting good sleep is often viewed as a simple matter of personal choice, but in New York City, sleep health reveals a complex story of neighborhood inequality and systemic disparities.\nAs someone fascinated by the intersection of public health and social justice, I chose to explore how sleep deprivation patterns vary across NYC’s diverse neighborhoods, particularly examining relationships with race and socioeconomic status from 2018-2022. NYC provides an ideal case study - within this densely packed city, neighborhood conditions can shift dramatically within blocks, from areas with serene tree-lined streets to those with constant traffic, sirens, and environmental stressors that make quality sleep elusive. These stark contrasts, combined with some of the nation’s largest wealth gaps and the unprecedented disruptions of COVID-19, offer a unique window into how structural inequities manifest in something as fundamental as sleep.\nThrough visualizing and analyzing CDC sleep health data alongside demographic information, this project investigates several key questions: How do sleep patterns vary across NYC neighborhoods? What roles do race and income play in these differences? And how did major events like the pandemic affect sleep disparities? Understanding these patterns is crucial, as poor sleep doesn’t just mean feeling tired - it’s linked to serious health conditions like heart disease and diabetes that already disproportionately impact communities of color and lower-income areas, potentially creating cycles where neighborhood conditions, sleep deprivation, and health challenges compound each other.",

Make sure to select all ZCTAs that fall within New York state!\n\nRace and Ethnicity Data\nSelected Demographics (Part 1)\nSelected Demographics (Part 2)\n\n\n\nSleep Data Over Time\nSleep data are obtained from the CDC’s PLACES Local Data for Better Health datasets directly from the CDC website (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, 2023, 2024). The PLACES datasets are created with ZCTA-level estimates derived from data collected through the nationally representative annual U.S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). The BRFSS is an annual, phone-based survey of the US population who are 18 years and older. The CDC works with local state health department to interview respondents. Every other year, the BRFSS includes a question asking “On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?”.\nUsing the BRFSS data, an estimate is created for the percentage of the population (per ZCTA) that reports sleeping &lt; 7 hours on average. Population data used to help model these estimates were drawn from the American Community Surveys (ACS) for each of the respective BRFSS years (2018, 2020, 2022). The ACS is collected and managed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Because sleep data is only collected every other year and PLACES short sleep prevalence estimates are created using the most recent year with available data (even if the year the data were collected does not align with the release year of the PLACES dataset).\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\n\n\n\n\nNYC ZCTA to Borough to Neighborhood Crosswalk File\nZCTA Shapefile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\n\n\n\nAll data cleaning files and steps can be found in the data_cleaning folder (BONUS: a funny joke and pun awaits inside if you can find it)",

This makes a lot of sense given the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown.\nManhattan appears to be the most well-rested (aka show the lowest population percentage of short sleep prevalence)\nInterestingly, most boroughs differences in short sleep prevalence remain consistent, but the Bronx shows a steep increase between 2020 and 2022, catching up to short sleep prevalence rates in Staten Island despite having been lower than the previous 2 year time points.\n\nLet’s now look at 2022 data on the map to see what it looks like geographically!\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(viridis)\n\nsleep_health_data_geo &lt;- st_read(\"data/sleep_health_geo_dataset.shp\", quiet =\n                                   TRUE)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n# Borough-level view with neighborhood labels\nsleep_health_data_geo |&gt;\n  group_by(borough) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_sleep = mean(prc_s22),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = avg_sleep)) +\n  geom_sf_label(aes(label = borough), \n                size = 3,\n                alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    option = \"magma\",\n    name = \"Average %\\nSleeping &lt;7hrs\",\n    direction = -1  # Added this line to flip the scale\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sleep Deprivation by Borough (2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Average percentage of adults reporting less than 7 hours of sleep\",\n    caption = \"Data source: CDC\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"gray30\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplicating what we saw in the line graph above, we see that the Bronx and Staten Island had very similar rates of short sleep prevalence, denoted by the similar dark purple/black color.\nHowever, another thing made clear in this graph (especially for those who are familiar with NYC) is that analyzing/exploring these data at the borough-level might be a bit too reductionist or over simplistic.

This strengthens (though does not definitively confirm) the idea that there may be geographic factors at play that influence sleep patterns, given that zip code areas closer together tend to trend in the same direction.\n\nNow let’s explore how these zip code areas shift over time!\n\n3.2.1 Neighborhood Sleep Trends Over Time\n\n\nCode\n# Faceted version showing change over time\nsleep_health_data_geo_long &lt;- sleep_health_data_geo |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(prc_s18, prc_s20, prc_s22),\n    names_to = \"year\",\n    values_to = \"sleep_perc\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(year = case_when(\n    year == \"prc_s18\" ~ \"2018\",\n    year == \"prc_s20\" ~ \"2020\",\n    year == \"prc_s22\" ~ \"2022\"\n  ))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = sleep_health_data_geo_long,\n          aes(fill = sleep_perc),\n          color = \"white\",\n          size = 0.1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    option = \"magma\",\n    name = \"% Adults\\nSleeping &lt;7hrs\",\n    limits = c(25, 50),\n    direction = -1  # Added this line to flip the scale\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~year) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Changes in Sleep Deprivation Across NYC (2018-2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Percentage of adults reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per night\",\n    caption = \"Data source: CDC\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"gray30\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause NYC has 177 zipcode areas, it would be too visually overwhelming to explore this data with each ZCTA as its own line on a multi-line plot. Instead, what we have visualized above is the same heat map of short sleep prevalence, with 1 plot per year.\nWe see the same 2020 trend where sleep improves across the board (as you can see from the whole map become shades lighter in 2020), but a new pattern becomes clear that was obscured by the overall borough trends over time in the line graph earlier.\n\nWhile all ZCTAs experienced a decrease in short sleep prevalence during the pandemic, there is an interesting pattern that emerges in 2022 where the ZCTAs who were sleeping fairly better did not bounce all the way back to their pre-pandemic levels (aka maintained sleep health gains from 2020), but for ZCTAs that had really high short sleep prevalence (&gt;45%, indexed by the deep dark purple color), their short sleep prevalence had returned to pre-pandemic level.\nWhile there is no data to support this, anecdotally we can intuit that remote/work from home flexibility is often afforded to higher paying jobs vs. lower paying jobs and disparities. It would be interesting to see how long this “pandemic” sleep effect lasts.

Specifically, these neighborhoods are concentrated in the South Bronx region. The South Bronx has historically been one of the most socioeconomically challenged areas in New York City, though it has undergone significant changes and development efforts in recent decades.\nAll these neighborhoods being in the Bronx is in line (hah, no pun intended!) with the multi-line plot we saw earlier where there was a steep increase in short sleep prevalence for the Bronx between 2020 and 2022, so much so that average 2022 levels were greater than average 2018 levels. A stark counter pattern to a lot of other neighborhood as you’re about to see in the 2018 to 2022 comparisons below..\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate mean sleep deprivation by neighborhood for each year\nneighborhood_sleep &lt;- aggregate(\n    cbind(perc_sleep18, perc_sleep22) ~ neighborhood,\n    data = df,\n    FUN = mean\n)\n\n# Calculate total change and get top 10 by absolute change\nneighborhood_sleep$total_change &lt;- neighborhood_sleep$perc_sleep22 - neighborhood_sleep$perc_sleep18\n\n# Split into increases and decreases\nincreases &lt;- neighborhood_sleep[neighborhood_sleep$total_change &gt; 0, ]\ndecreases &lt;- neighborhood_sleep[neighborhood_sleep$total_change &lt; 0, ]\n\n# Get top 5 from each\ntop_5_increases &lt;- increases[order(-increases$total_change), ][1:5, ]\ntop_5_decreases &lt;- decreases[order(decreases$total_change), ][1:5, ]\n\n# Combine and order\ntop_changes &lt;- rbind(top_5_increases, top_5_decreases)\ntop_changes$change_type &lt;- ifelse(top_changes$total_change &gt; 0, \"Increased\", \"Decreased\")\n\n# Create factor with custom ordering\ntop_changes$neighborhood &lt;- factor(top_changes$neighborhood,\n                                 levels = c(rev(top_5_decreases$neighborhood), \n                                          rev(top_5_increases$neighborhood)))\n\n# Define a brighter green for improvements\nbright_green &lt;- \"#2ecc71\"  # A more distinct green color\n\nggplot(top_changes, aes(y = neighborhood)) +\n    # Add colored background for increase/decrease sections\n    annotate(\"rect\", \n            ymin = 5.5, ymax = 10.5,\n            xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf,\n            fill = \"#f8f8f8\", alpha = 0.5) +\n    # Original plot elements\n    geom_segment(aes(x = perc_sleep18, xend = perc_sleep22,\n                    yend = neighborhood,\n                    color = change_type),\n                size = 0.8) +\n    geom_point(aes(x = perc_sleep18), color = color_2018, size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +\n    geom_point(aes(x = perc_sleep22), color = color_2022, size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +\n    # Add absolute change values\n    geom_text(aes(x = max(c(perc_sleep18, perc_sleep22)) + 1,\n                  label = sprintf(\"%+.1f%%\", total_change),\n                  color = change_type),\n              hjust = 0, size = 3) +\n    # Updated year labels\n    geom_text(data = data.frame(x = min(top_changes$perc_sleep18),\n                               y = max(as.numeric(top_changes$neighborhood)) + 0.5),\n              aes(x = x, y = y),\n              label = \"2018\",\n              color = color_2018,\n              hjust = 0.5,\n              size = 3) +\n    geom_text(data = data.frame(x = max(top_changes$perc_sleep22),\n                               y = max(as.numeric(top_changes$neighborhood)) + 0.5),\n              aes(x = x, y = y),\n              label = \"2022\",\n              color = color_2022,\n              hjust = 0.5,\n              size = 3) +\n    # Theming\n    scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Increased\" = \"#d35f5f\", \"Decreased\" = bright_green),\n                      guide = \"none\") +\n    scale_y_discrete() +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    labs(\n        title = \"Largest Changes in Sleep Deprivation (2018 to 2022)\",\n        subtitle = \"Top 5 increases and decreases in percentage of population reporting insufficient sleep\",\n        x = \"Percent Sleep Deprived\",\n        y = NULL\n    ) +\n    theme(\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, color = \"grey40\"),\n        plot.margin = margin(t = 20, r = 60, b = 20, l = 20, unit = \"pt\")  # Reduced left margin\n    ) +\n    scale_x_continuous(\n        limits = c(\n            min(top_changes$perc_sleep18, top_changes$perc_sleep22) - 4,\n            max(top_changes$perc_sleep18, top_changes$perc_sleep22) + 4\n        )\n    ) +\n    coord_cartesian(clip = \"off\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, once we move onto comparisons between 2018 and 2022, the top 10 neighborhoods that show the greatest changes are no longer unidirectional (as compared to the previous 2 dot plots). There is certainly a lot to unpack here!\n\nClear geographic disparity: Manhattan and Queens neighborhoods saw significant improvements (3-4% decrease in sleep deprivation), while Bronx neighborhoods showed deterioration (1-1.6% increase)\nPotential socioeconomic divide: Improvements concentrated in more affluent areas (TriBeCa, Lower East Side) while historically underserved communities saw worse sleep patterns\nCOVID-19 and WFH impact: Areas with high concentrations of knowledge workers who could work from home (e.g., TriBeCa, Lower East Side) saw the biggest improvements, while areas with more essential workers (Bronx) saw deterioration\nPopulation shifts may be a factor: Changes could partly reflect pandemic-era migration patterns and housing market changes rather than just changes in sleep behavior of existing residents\n\n\nNow that we’ve looked deeply into patterns of change, let’s explore overall which neighborhoods are sleeping more than others.\n\n\n3.2.3 Which neighborhoods are sleeping the most?\n\n\nCode\n# Neighborhood-level view labeling areas with best sleep\nsleep_health_data_geo |&gt;\n group_by(borough) |&gt;\n # Get bottom 3 neighborhoods per borough (lowest sleep deprivation = best sleep)\n mutate(\n   should_label = rank(prc_s22, ties.method = \"random\") &lt;= 3  # Changed from -prc_s22 to prc_s22 to get lowest values\n ) |&gt;\n ungroup() |&gt;\n ggplot() +\n geom_sf(aes(fill = prc_s22)) +\n geom_label_repel(\n   data = . %&gt;% filter(should_label),\n   aes(\n     label = nghbrhd,\n     geometry = geometry\n   ),\n   stat = \"sf_coordinates\",\n   size = 2.5,\n   alpha = 0.9,\n   box.padding = 0.5,\n   point.padding = 0.2,\n   max.overlaps = 30,\n   force = 10\n ) +\n scale_fill_viridis(\n   option = \"magma\",\n   name = \"Average %\\nSleeping &lt;7hrs\",\n   direction = -1\n ) +\n theme_minimal() +\n labs(\n   title = \"Sleep Deprivation by NYC Neighborhood (2022)\",\n   subtitle = \"Labels shown for three neighborhoods with lowest sleep deprivation per borough\",\n   caption = \"Data source: CDC\"\n ) +\n theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n   plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"gray30\"),\n   legend.position = \"right\",\n   panel.grid = element_blank(),\n   axis.text = element_blank()\n )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Which neighborhoods are sleeping the least?\n\n\nCode\n# Neighborhood-level view with selective repelling labels\nsleep_health_data_geo |&gt;\n  group_by(borough) |&gt;\n  # Get top 3 neighborhoods per borough\n  mutate(\n    should_label = rank(-prc_s22, ties.method = \"random\") &lt;= 3\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = prc_s22)) +\n  geom_label_repel(\n    data = . %&gt;% filter(should_label),\n    aes(\n      label = nghbrhd,\n      geometry = geometry\n    ),\n    stat = \"sf_coordinates\",\n    size = 2.5,\n    alpha = 0.9,\n    box.padding = 0.5,\n    point.padding = 0.2,\n    max.overlaps = 30,\n    force = 10\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    option = \"magma\",\n    name = \"Average %\\nSleeping &lt;7hrs\",\n    direction = -1\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sleep Deprivation by NYC Neighborhood (2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Labels shown for three neighborhoods with highest sleep deprivation per borough\",\n    caption = \"Data source: CDC\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"gray30\"),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have a sense of sleep deprivation over time and by neighborhood, let’s explore its relationship with some demographic data..",

If two arrows point away from one another (180º angle) they tend to be negatively correlated, and if two arrows form a 90º angle then they are orthogonal and not highly related.\n\nThe PCA biplot shows sleep deprivation strongly correlates with lower income, lower education levels, and lower insurance coverage, while being more prevalent in areas with higher Black populations - this helps explain the neighborhood patterns we saw earlier\nThese relationships between sleep and socioeconomic factors remain consistent across all three years (2018, 2020, 2022), suggesting persistent disparities rather than temporary pandemic effects\nThe stark opposing relationship between White and Black populations in relation to sleep deprivation reflects the geographic divides we observed, where predominantly White, higher-income areas like TriBeCa maintained their pandemic sleep improvements while other areas saw sleep health deteriorate\nInsurance coverage, income, and education clustering together suggests these advantages (or disadvantages) tend to compound - potentially explaining why certain neighborhoods experienced such different sleep health trajectories during and after the pandemic\nLastly, we pulled out the outliers in each corner to get a better sense of the extremes within our dataset\n\nIn case you were curious, those 4 outliers are and here are some of their key demographics…\n\n\nCode\ndf |&gt; \n  filter(zcta5 %in% c(11368, 11212, 11360, 10004)) |&gt; \n  select(\"zcta5\", \"neighborhood\", \"borough\", \"nh_total\", \"white\", \"black\",\n         \"asian\", \"hispanic\", \"total\", \"inc_mean\", \"ins_total\", \"edu_min_ba\", \n         \"total_25yo\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    perc_white = white / nh_total * 100,\n    perc_black = black / nh_total * 100,\n    perc_asian = asian / nh_total * 100,\n    perc_hispanic = hispanic / total * 100,\n    inc_mean = as.numeric(inc_mean),\n    ins_total = as.numeric(ins_total),\n    perc_ba_plus = edu_min_ba / total_25yo * 100\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(-\"nh_total\", -\"white\", -\"black\",\n         -\"asian\", -\"hispanic\", -\"total\", -\"edu_min_ba\", \n         -\"total_25yo\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzcta5\nneighborhood\nborough\ninc_mean\nins_total\nperc_white\nperc_black\nperc_asian\nperc_hispanic\nperc_ba_plus\n\n\n\n\n10004\nFinancial District\nManhattan\n232543\n99.7\n59.080460\n5.793103\n31.4942529\n5.001092\n94.47853\n\n\n11212\nBrownsville\nBrooklyn\n35840\n92.7\n4.313952\n87.009358\n0.9742612\n19.480751\n15.74208\n\n\n11360\nBayside\nQueens\n100016\n95.2\n61.253465\n1.334917\n34.3741162\n10.345352\n51.44637\n\n\n11368\nCorona\nQueens\n69391\n76.6\n18.382866\n30.755667\n46.4090224\n75.857206\n13.65266",

There’s a striking mirror-image pattern between the Black and White population graphs - as Black population percentage increases, sleep deprivation increases (positive slope), while as White population percentage increases, sleep deprivation decreases (negative slope).\n\nThis relationship holds true across all income levels, though it’s particularly pronounced in the upper-middle and high-income brackets.\n\nEven in high-income areas, we see places with higher Black populations showing higher sleep deprivation rates (around 45%) compared to areas with higher White populations showing lower rates (around 35%) - this 10% gap hints at other factors beyond income that might affect sleep health, like environmental stressors, healthcare access, or work schedule flexibility.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Through this exploration of sleep health disparities across NYC neighborhoods from 2018-2022, we’ve uncovered some concerning patterns of inequity that persist even when controlling for income levels.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic initially led to improved sleep across all areas in 2020, the recovery has been uneven - neighborhoods with higher percentages of White residents and greater socioeconomic resources (like TriBeCa and the Lower East Side) largely maintained their sleep health gains, while predominantly Black neighborhoods and areas with more essential workers (particularly in the Bronx) saw sleep deprivation return to or exceed pre-pandemic levels.\nMost strikingly, even when comparing neighborhoods within the same income bracket, areas with higher Black populations consistently showed higher rates of sleep deprivation than those with higher White populations, pointing to racial disparities that can’t be explained by income differences alone.\nThis suggests we need to look beyond purely economic factors to address sleep health inequities, considering elements like work schedule flexibility, environmental stressors, and healthcare access that may vary systematically across neighborhoods. As more post-pandemic data becomes available, researchers should continue monitoring these patterns to inform targeted interventions that can help ensure all New Yorkers have equal opportunity for healthy sleep.",
